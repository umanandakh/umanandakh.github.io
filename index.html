<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> In mathematics, the Laplace transform, named after its discoverer Pierre-Simon Laplace , is an integral transform that converts a function of a real variable  to a function of a complex variable. The transform has many applications in science and engineering because it is a tool for solving differential equations.In particular, it transforms ordinary differential equations into algebraic equations and convolution into multiplication. For suitable functions f, the Laplace transform is the integral.</p>
<p> Laplace transform, in mathematics, a particular integral transform invented by the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), and systematically developed by the British physicist Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925),to simplify the solution of many differential equations that describe physical processes. It is useful to simplify the mathematical computations and it can be used for easy analysis of signals and systems. We used the Laplace transform to solve differential equations,the solutions are functions of the Laplace transform variable ‘s‘ rather of the time variable ‘t‘. Therefore we must have a method for converting from function ‘s‘ back to function of t, this produce is called Inverse Laplace transform. </p>

<p> Laplace transformation plays a major role in control system engineering. To analyze the control system, Laplace transforms of different functions have to be carried out. Both the properties of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transformation are used in analyzing the dynamic control system. In this article, we will discuss in detail the definition of Laplace transform, its formula, properties, Laplace transform table and its applications in a detailed way.</p>
