<p> The Laplace transform is named after mathematician and astronomer <em> Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace,</em> who used a similar transform in his work on probability theory. Laplace wrote extensively about the use of generating functions in Essai philosophique sur les probabilit√©s (1814), and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.</p>
<p> Laplace's use of generating functions was similar to what is now known as the z-transform, and he gave little attention to the continuous variable case which was discussed by <em>Niels Henrik Abel</em>. The theory was further developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries by Mathias Lerch, Oliver Heaviside, and Thomas Bromwich.</p>
<p> The current widespread use of the transform (mainly in engineering) came about during and soon after World War II,replacing the earlier Heaviside operational calculus. The advantages of the Laplace transform had been emphasized by <em>Gustav Doetsch </em>, to whom the name Laplace transform is apparently due </p>
<p> From 1744, <em>Leonhard Euler </em> investigated integrals of the form </p>
 <p> z= &int;X(x)e<sup>ax</sup>dx and z=&int;X(x)x<sup>A</sup>dx </p>
<p> as solutions of differential equations, but did not pursue the matter very far. Joseph Louis Lagrange was an admirer of Euler and, in his work on integrating probability density functions, investigated expressions of the form </p>
<p> &int;X(x)e<sup>-ax</sup>a<sup>x</sup>dx, </p>
<p> which some modern historians have interpreted within modern Laplace transform theory.</p> 
<p> These types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplace's attention in 1782, where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations. However, in 1785, Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than simply looking for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form</p>
<p> &int;x<sup>s</sup>f(x)dx,</p>
<p> akin to a Mellin transform, to transform the whole of a difference equation, in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.</p>
<p> Laplace also recognised that Joseph Fourier's method of Fourier series for solving the diffusion equation could only apply to a limited region of space, because those solutions were periodic. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space. </p>
